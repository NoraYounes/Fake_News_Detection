> ## Overview
Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. There is no fixed definition of a false news story, and, in fact, the term is used more broadly to encompass any type of misinformation, including unintentional and unconscious mechanisms, and also to apply to news unfavourable to one's own personal views.

In a time when we can spread and receive information quickly, thanks to the technology and 4G networks , media literacy is very important. 
Detecting fake news has become more important than ever for the sake of a peaceful society. A prediction tool would be a terrific way to help people make more educated decisions on news. 

We are working on a solution that users can use to identify news containing false and misleading information. The post and title of a fake article are analyzed using simple and carefully selected features. 

> ## Data Sourcing 
A large set of True and Fake news would be used to create a model which would predict whether an input is True or False based on that model.

- The primary Dataset is from [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/ece/isot/datasets/fake-news/index.php) and [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data).
- [Top 20 Fake/Real words](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/04/machine-learning-fake-news-accuracy.html) using Naive Bayes classifier.

> ## The purpose of this analysis is to answer the following question:
- Is the article true or false? 
- What is the accuracy of the predictive model? 
- Fake news has many sources, where do most of them come from?

> ## Communication Protocols
